🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzes customer interactions and purchase history.
- 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends based on user similarity.
- 🔍 **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests products using product metadata and descriptions.
- 🖼️ **Image Recognition**: Uses deep learning to generate visual product recommendations.
- 🧪 **A/B Testing Framework**: Evaluates the effectiveness of marketing strategies.
- 📊 **Streamlit Dashboard**: Visualizes metrics, test results, and insights.

## 🧩 Phases of Development

### Phase 1: Setup & Data Collection

- Setup Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook
- Install core libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`
- Use a public dataset (e.g., Amazon products from Kaggle)
- Set up PostgreSQL and define schemas for:
  - Customers
  - Products
  - User interactions

---

### Phase 2: Basic Recommendation System

- Implement **collaborative filtering** (user-based)
- Build **content-based filtering** using product features
- Serve recommendations through a **Flask API**

---

### Phase 3: Image Recognition

- Use **OpenCV** + **pretrained models** (ResNet) to extract image features
- Build visual similarity metrics
- Store embeddings in a searchable format

---

### Phase 4: A/B Testing Framework

- Design test/control group logic
- Track performance metrics (CTR, conversion)
- Use `Streamlit` to visualize campaign performance

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Integrate with real-time data pipelines
- Improve scalability with cloud deployment (e.g., AWS/GCP)
- Add user authentication and role-based dashboards
